# Hello!

Welcome to my site.

I built a couple of 3D simulations in Glowscript (VPython).

The goal is to help you out if you're trying to build something similar.

Feel free to steal the code!

## The Projects

1.  [**The Entropy Cube**](entropy_cube.md): A big box made of smaller boxes that light up based on how many particles are bouncing around inside them.
2.  [**The Fire Sim**](fire_simulation.md): Fancy fire simulation, actually calculating entropy using Boltzmann's formula.
